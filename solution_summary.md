# Solution Summary: Template Variable Not Rendering

## Issue

The string literal `{{ calendar.get_room_type_display }}` was appearing in the user interface instead of being rendered
as the actual room type value.

## Root Cause

In the `success.html` template, there was a line break between the opening template tag `{{` and the variable
`calendar.get_room_type_display }}`. This syntax error prevented Django's template engine from recognizing and
processing the variable.

## Solution

The solution was to fix the template syntax by removing the line break:

**Before:**

```html
<li class="list-group-item bg-transparent text-white border-white">Room Type: {{
    calendar.get_room_type_display }}
</li>
```

**After:**

```html
<li class="list-group-item bg-transparent text-white border-white">Room Type: {{ calendar.get_room_type_display }}
</li>
```

## Verification

After making this change, the template variable should be properly rendered, showing the actual room type (either "Study
Room" or "Program Room") instead of the literal string.

## Preventive Measures

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Ensure that template variables are written on a single line or properly formatted across multiple lines
2. Use a linter or validator for Django templates
3. Thoroughly test template rendering after making changes

## Related Information

Django automatically creates methods like `get_field_display()` for model fields with choices. In this case,
`get_room_type_display()` is automatically created for the `room_type` field in the `CalendarGeneration` model, which
has choices defined as:

```python
ROOM_CHOICES = [
    ('study', 'Study Room'),
    ('program', 'Program Room'),
]
```
